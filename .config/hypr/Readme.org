#+title: Hyprland Config

* Introduction

  This is the configuration for my personal setup, it is a work in progress and is constantly changing.

  It's designed to be similar to LeftWM / DWM in terms of keybindings but with more scratchpads. Holding ALT makes it behave more like i3.

  ** Features

  + Scratchpads
  + Wofi Window Switcher
  + Waybar
  + Resizing
    + Modal
    + Dynamic
  + Nvidia Configuration
  + Window Rules

* Keybindings
