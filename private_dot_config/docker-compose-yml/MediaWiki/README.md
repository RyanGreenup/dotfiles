# Running it as a docker
MediaWiki is simply not suited to running as a docker.

I cannot get it to work, full stop period.

More over I cannot get the parsoid editor to work, as much as I love the style and look of mediawiki and as nice as the parsoid editor is I don't think it's worth pursuing, it's just going to be a headache, play and simple, it's just too fucking complicated to set up.


Consider pepperminty, copy/paste.
Consider wikijs, docker-compose.

It's simple enough without parsoid but setting up parsoid is an absolute fucking nightmare.
